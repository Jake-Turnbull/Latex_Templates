\section{Subsections}

Here we are going to show how to do subsections, unsurprisingly it is incredibly easy

\subsection{Subsction 4.1, a section within a chapter}
Here we have created a subsection, every time we do this our contents page will automatically update with the page number and title

\subsubsection{Another one?}
You can go even deeper and make sub-sections if you need to further break up a chapter
\subsubsection{Just one more}
This is only really for very very long pieces of work (200 pages +) so if you are writing a Masters thesis its probably not worth using them.
