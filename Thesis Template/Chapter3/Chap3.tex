\section{Referencing examples}

This chapter and any future ones will be structured however you like and will be more specific to your project, the names and contents will likely be the result of lengthy conversation with supervisors (I'm just guessing though I haven't started yet).

We, however are going to use this chapter to give an example of referencing and show how easy it is to build your bibliography.

When referencing we use the cite{} command, here we will add a reference used in a report about exo-planets \cite{fulton_california-kepler_2017}, this will appear as an in-text reference in APA style. It will also be automatically added to our reference list at the end of the document automatically
