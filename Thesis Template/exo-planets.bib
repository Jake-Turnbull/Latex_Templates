              The size of a planet is an observable property directly connected to the physics of its formation and evolution. We used precise radius measurements from the California-
              Kepler
              Survey to study the size distribution of 2025
              Kepler
              planets in fine detail. We detect a factor of ≥2 deficit in the occurrence rate distribution at 1.5–2.0

	abstract = {We present a library of empirical stellar spectra created using spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey’s Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. The templates cover spectral types O5 through L3, are binned by metallicity from −2.0 dex through +1.0 dex, and are separated into main-sequence (dwarf) stars and giant stars. With recently developed M dwarf metallicity indicators, we are able to extend the metallicity bins down through the spectral subtype M8, making this the first empirical library with this degree of temperature and metallicity coverage. The wavelength coverage for the templates is from 3650 to 10200 Å at a resolution of better than R ∼ 2000. Using the templates, we identify trends in color space with metallicity and surface gravity, which will be useful for analyzing large data sets from upcoming missions like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Along with the templates, we are releasing a code for automatically (and/or visually) identifying the spectral type and metallicity of a star.},

	abstract = {The search for habitable planets has revealed many planets that can vary greatly from an Earth analog environment. These include highly eccentric orbits, giant planets, different bulk densities, relatively active stars, and evolved stars. This work catalogs all planets found to reside in the habitable zone (HZ) and provides HZ boundaries, orbit characterization, and the potential for spectroscopic follow-up observations. Demographics of the HZ planets are compared with a full catalog of exoplanets. Extreme planets within the HZ are highlighted, and how their unique properties may affect their potential habitability is discussed. Kepler-296 f is the most eccentric 2 R⊕ planet that spends 100\% of its orbit in the HZ. HD 106270 b and HD 38529 c are the most massive planets (13 MJ) that orbit within the HZ, and are ideal targets for determining the properties of potential hosts of HZ exomoons. These planets, along with the others highlighted, will serve as special edge cases to the Earth-based scenario, and observations of these targets will help test the resilience of habitability outside the standard model. The most promising observational HZ target that is known to transit is GJ 414 A b. Of the transiting, 2 R⊕ HZ planets, LHS 1140 b, TRAPPIST-1 d, and K2-3 d are the most favorable. Of the nontransiting HZ planets, HD 102365 b and 55 Cnc f are the most promising, and the best nontransiting candidates that have 2 R⊕ are GJ 667 C c, Wolf 1061 c, Ross 508 b, Teegarden’s Star b, and Proxima Cen b.},

	abstract = {A new generation of observatories is enabling detailed study of exoplanetary atmospheres and the diversity of alien climates, allowing us to seek evidence for extraterrestrial biological and geological processes. Now is therefore the time to identify the most unique planets to be characterised with these instruments. In this context, we report on the discovery and validation of TOI-715 b, a \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\}=1.55{\textbackslash}pm 0.06{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ planet orbiting its nearby (\$42\$ pc) M4 host (TOI-715/TIC 271971130) with a period \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\} = 19.288004\_\{-0.000024\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.000027\}\$ days. TOI-715 b was first identified by TESS and validated using ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging and statistical validation. The planet's orbital period combined with the stellar effective temperature \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}=3075{\textbackslash}pm75{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm K\$ give this planet an instellation \$S\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\} = 0.67\_\{-0.20\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm S\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, placing it within the most conservative definitions of the habitable zone for rocky planets. TOI-715 b's radius falls exactly between two measured locations of the M-dwarf radius valley; characterising its mass and composition will help understand the true nature of the radius valley for low-mass stars. We demonstrate TOI-715 b is amenable for characterisation using precise radial velocities and transmission spectroscopy. Additionally, we reveal a second candidate planet in the system, TIC 271971130.02, with a potential orbital period of \$P\_\{02\} = 25.60712\_\{-0.00036\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.00031\}\$ days and a radius of \$R\_\{02\} = 1.066{\textbackslash}pm0.092{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, just inside the outer boundary of the habitable zone, and near a 4:3 orbital period commensurability. Should this second planet be confirmed, it would represent the smallest habitable zone planet discovered by TESS to date.},

	abstract = {A minimal cell can be thought of as comprising informational, compartment-forming and metabolic subsystems. To imagine the abiotic assembly of such an overall system, however, places great demands on hypothetical prebiotic chemistry. The perceived differences and incompatibilities between these subsystems have led to the widely held assumption that one or other subsystem must have preceded the others. Here we experimentally investigate the validity of this assumption by examining the assembly of various biomolecular building blocks from prebiotically plausible intermediates and one-carbon feedstock molecules. We show that precursors of ribonucleotides, amino acids and lipids can all be derived by the reductive homologation of hydrogen cyanide and some of its derivatives, and thus that all the cellular subsystems could have arisen simultaneously through common chemistry. The key reaction steps are driven by ultraviolet light, use hydrogen sulfide as the reductant and can be accelerated by Cu(I)-Cu(II) photoredox cycling.},
