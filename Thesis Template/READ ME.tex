This is simply a read me file going over some things that are not covered in the comments of the main or subsections:

1. Your images do not need to be in the required folders, but it may help for management and organisation so it is hard to. If you want to reuse a figure for some reason in order to reference it later or something else, you can do so by simply using the full path.

2. The text files in this project do not work as independent files, meaning they have the same commands and packages as the main text file. 
This in some cases is not optimal as you may one individual chapters to have their own packages,
this can be done when specifying the subsections at the start of each text file. 
Using the command slash followed by documentclass[../main.tex]{standalone}, for additional information regarding this please visit this URL
