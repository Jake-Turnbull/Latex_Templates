\minitoc \mtcskip 
This is the first major chapter of your thesis, you are likely to be working on this almost up until you submit. As a general idea for structure a good resource for types of reviews for PHD theses can be found here \href{https://www.ncl.ac.uk/academic-skills-kit/assessment/dissertations-and-theses/structuring-a-literature-review/}{STRUCTURING A LIT REVIEW}. This page shows general structures that a literature review can take which should help before you start writing. It is also important to check with your supervisors to see which kind of review you should do (systematic, critical etc)
