\documentclass[../main.tex]{subfiles}

\begin{document}
%% Here we can write in any abbreviations or definitions that are useful remember. There is a way to more 'effectively' do this using the glossaries package, but from my experience its hard to get working so its just as easy to write manually:


\section*{Glossary}
Here we can manually add definitions and abbreviations that are useful to remember before starting the main document, it is still good to redefine them at least once in text but this is a good list to come back to.

\subsection*{Definitions}
\textbf{Hogwarts} - A school for magical British children that wouldn't recieve a good Ofsted score

\subsection*{Abbreviations}
\textbf{MRI} - Magnetic Resonance Imaging
\textbf{MEG} - Magnetoencephalogray
